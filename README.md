Description: This program generates an interactive 3-dimensional ogre, starting by generating a skeleton and expanding to 
			 include linear blend skinning, bone picking and manipulation, and texture mapping.

Disclaimers: Phong shading is not implemented (we were not able to get phong shading to work in the previous assignment and
			 it is not required under this circumstance, according to the piazza post, https://piazza.com/class/iji109zho1854q?cid=201).
